# Labelless Conditional GAN

Typically, conditional image synthesis with a generative adversarial network (GAN) is achieved by providing the generator a class label. This code implements a novel (to my knowledge) GAN loss function that allows for image synthesis conditioned on a raw input image. In detail, the GAN is provided both sampled noise and an image to condition on. The noise is upsampled as usual while the image is downsampled and the resulting hidden representations are concatenated. But for any standard GAN loss, the optimal generator would act as an identity function on the provided image. The solution I propose is the following loss function:
